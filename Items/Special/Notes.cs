/ <Enemy/Event>Toggle.cs ~ These just toggle the respective flags in the  /

/ The SawBlade staff is entirely based on world progression. Killing      /
/ enemies and downing bosses, including all vanilla events will powerup   /
/ the weapon itself, immensely increasing it's potential in combat. Once  /
/ this weapon is fully worked on, I'll add more weapons, but this weapon  /
/ is testing me hardcore on flag events. Everything will be finalized at  /
/ a later point, but when the weapon is fully powered up, you'll know it. /

/ Take note that this uses every event in the base game before Terraria   /
/ 1.4. This includes all invasions(even the the Frost Legion) the player  /
/ can access. As an added bonus, I'm including the Summon for the Frost   /
/ Legion as a vanilla drop from Krampus with a 10% chance.                /
