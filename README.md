# TerrariaModStingermanMod
This is a C# mod for tModLoader for my custom mod of Terraria.

Currently this just adds some debug features for testing the mod itself as well as 4 items, one of which(a magic staff) is being heavily worked on. You can find the current build under tModLoader's mod browser labeled "Messing Around". That is outdated and will be hopefully updated when I get this 'simple' weapon completed.
