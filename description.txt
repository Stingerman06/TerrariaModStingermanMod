This is a basic mod I want to use and mess around with for learning the basics of modding Terraria!

I'm new to making mods, but I have silly ideas I want to add in.

Expect this mod to have random things added. Will update as I go.

Notice: I may not answer all messages, but I will keep them in mind.

Compatibility:
UNKNOWN! I'm relatively new to coding, so don't expect this mod to be 100% compatible with any other mods(or even multiplayer)!


Version 0.0.2

Fixed actual version number.

4 new items


Reworked Sawblade Staff

Can no longer use in a non-expert world.*

Sawblade Staff no longer scales with progression.** Must be upgraded through 2 paths, and cannot gain modifiers anymore.
The two paths are noted as "Tier" upgrades and "Rarity Upgrades". ***

Tier upgrades increase base crit, knockback and projectile reliability(hits per projectile, hit speed, ect.).
Rarity Upgrades change the staff's behavior, increases damage and overall speed.
All upgrades increases the base price, but is it worth it?


* Reason being I'm still learning constructors and method extenders, so I initially wanted to make the crafting/availability Expert only, but I lack the expertise.

** Still under development.

*** These are all separate items, yeah. It would be easier to modify values based on progression, yeah but I wanted to avoid seeing "+400% Damage" when checking it's stats.
154 itterations of this weapon in case you're curious.

Re-organized files so items from this mod must be acquired again.
